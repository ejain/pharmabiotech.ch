			<strong>Meeting Report: Cambridge Healthtech Institute's Second 
			Annual Conference on lab-chip and microarrays held in Zuerich, 
			Switzerland, from 17-19 January 2000.</strong><br />

			<p>The biochip industry started using miniaturization, integration 
			and parallel-processing techniques based on those used in the 
			computer industry to develop laboratory devices. This technology is 
			now revolutionizing genomics, drug development, environmental 
			monitoring and clinical diagnostics, in much the same way as the 
			microprocessor transformed the computer industry. The reasons 
			underlying the success of this technology are its improved 
			performance, higher throughput, lower cost, portability and 
			automation. Recent advances in lab-chips and microarrays for 
			biotechnical and biomedical applications were the focus of a recent 
			meeting*, which covered research areas including diagnostics, 
			microfluidics, genomic microarray systems and bioinformatics.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Diagnostic applications</h2>
			
			<p>Hugh Fan (Sarnoff Corporation, Princeton, NJ, USA) presented a 
			hand-held, DNA chip-based biodetector system1, in which 
			paramagnetic beads are coupled with microfluidics and the 
			photodetection system is integrated in the device. Dynamic DNA 
			hybridization was achieved for both targets and probes, indicating 
			the potential application of this approach in gene expression 
			analysis. A high-density DNA probe array, developed by Affymetrix 
			(Santa Clara, CA, USA), has important applications for the 
			identification of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> species and the 
			ability to detect of rifampicin resistance in a single platform. 
			Alain Troesch (bioMerieux, Rockland, MA, USA) demonstrated that, by 
			hybridizing labelled amplified genetic material from bacterial 
			colonies to the array, this technology opens up new perspectives 
			for the management of bacterial diseases in patients2. Elisabeth 
			Verpoorte (University of Neuchatel, Neuchatel, Switzerland) 
			described a multifunctional lab-on-a-chip, for automated 
			immunoassays. Micromachined channels etched in glass enable the 
			controlled microflow of fluids by the application of strong 
			electric fields. It is not practical to use pumps on these devices 
			as fluid flow is difficult to control. Chemistry and optical 
			systems are integrated in this chip, which shows promise for 
			automated, rapid and ultra-small volume assays.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Microfluidics</h2>
			
			<p>Microreaction technology offers several advantages in process 
			engineering and biochemistry3. Wolfgang Ehrenfeld (Institut f�	Mikrotechnik, Mainz, Germany) described the chemical laboratory of 
			the future with miniaturized modules for unit operations in 
			chemical technology. Two significant products based on this 
			technology are: (1) the 96-channel electrophoresis chip (credit-card 
			size); and (2) the proteome chip. Genomics lab automation is 
			expected to be completed in the year 2000 and proteomics chips 
			should be available by the year 2004.</p>
			
			<p>The concept of polymer foundry as a key to the microfabrication 
			of disposable microfluidic devices, was presented by Holger Becker 
			(Jenoptik Mikrotechnik, Jena, Germany). This is a low-cost 
			polymer-replication process that enables the mass fabrication of 
			microstructures by Hot Embossing4. The applications of microfluidic 
			technology include: chips for capillary electrophoresis, flow 
			cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. In the future, 
			nanotechnology will be used to fabricate structures with nanometer 
			features for molecular engineering.</p>
	
			<p>Anthony Rico (ACLARA Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) 
			described low-cost, plastic microfluidic systems for 
			high-throughput screening and clinical diagnostics. The Drug Discovery  
			LabCard(TM) has an integrated fluid transfer system, and an 
			incubation, separation and detection in a standard 96-well format. 
			Disposability of these cards obviates the problems of carry-over 
			and contamination. Michael Knapp (Caliper Technologies, Mountain 
			view, CA, USA) described the microfluidic LabChip(TM) technology for 
			pharmaceutical screening and its genomic applications 
			(ultra-high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping). It 
			can perform experiments using as little as 1-10 nanolitres of reagents 
			and high-throughput is achieved using an assembly line 
			approach.</p>
			
			<h2>Genomic microchip and microarray systems</h2>
			
			<p>Frederico Goodsaid (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) 
			described the probes designed for the TaqMan(TM) array and their 
			application in the drug discovery process. The MicroCard Assembly 
			(a system of fixtures) enables the TaqMan(TM) assay to be carried out 
			in very small volumes and at reduced cost. Alex Chenchik (Clontech 
			Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA) presented the use of Atlas DNA 
			expression arrays for high-throughput expression profiling. For 
			tumour profiling with the Human Tumour Array, RNA is isolated from 
			the tumour tissue as well as the control tissue, and differentially 
			expressed genes are isolated.</p>
			
			<p>Jeffrey Killian (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA, USA) 
			presented Micromax(TM), a highly sensitive cDNA microarray system 
			which uses Tyramide Signal Amplification technology that enables 
			the detection of very small amounts of mRNA. Martin Davies 
			(Biorobotics, Cambridge, UK) introduced the second-generation 
			robotic microarray systems, MicroGrid Pro and MicroGrid TAS, which 
			have been designed to address the problems that are associated with 
			the use of current systems: (1) sample evaporation and (2) 
			carryover. The new systems offer significantly faster processing, 
			spotting density (as low as 10 mm), ease of use and automated 
			bar-code reading. Their main uses are in comparative genome 
			hybridization, gene expression profiling and single nucleotide 
			polymorphism analysis.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Newer arrays, chips and other designs</h2>
			
			<p>Jonathan Cooper (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland), 
			presented various novel, lab-on-a-chip technologies for the 
			expression-based screening of drug leads in the drug-discovery 
			process. These include single cell micro-biosensors, which are 
			optical assays with three-dimensional chips and flow-through DNA 
			chips. The significant feature of these technologies was the 
			integration of optics and fluidics (electro-osmosis). Bernhard 
			Weigl (Micronics, Redmond, WA, USA) described T-sensor technology 
			for microfluidic whole-blood diagnosis (electrolytes and drug 
			screening). Analytes can be detected by the application of optical 
			and electrochemical methods in microvolumes of complex solutions, 
			with internal standards to compensate for common experimental 
			variations. Huw Davies (Ciphergen Biosystems, Surrey, UK) described 
			the use of ProteinChip(R) arrays based on the surface enhanced laser 
			desorption-ionisation, time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology 
			for rapid biomarker discovery and characterization. Expression 
			profiling with ProteinChip(R) is likely to be integrated into the 
			proteomics laboratory of the future.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Array reading and bioinformatics</h2>
			
			<p>With the considerable amount of data generated by the different 
			technologies using microarrays, it is obvious that the reading of 
			the information and its interpretation and management through the 
			use of bioinformatics is essential. Thus, on the final day, the 
			lab-chip conference overlapped with the Cambridge Healthtech conference 
			on Bioinformatics which was following the former conference. David 
			Rank (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) reported on the 
			Integrated Expressed Sequence Tag Sequencing and 'cDNA Microarray' 
			projects. The merging of these two approaches enables the 
			identification of novel diagnostic genes with a potential for 
			toxicology screening. All toxicants ultimately influence gene 
			expression and the patterns of gene expression resulting from 
			chemical exposure are unique to a specific chemical and referred to 
			as 'fingerprints'. A fingerprint of dioxin, a model chemical for a 
			large class of environmental contaminants, has been developed in 
			the mouse liver. Approximately 24 genes have been identified, the 
			regulation of which is potentially altered following 
			tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure. Further developments include: 
			increased  gene density on the toxicology chip to include 1200-1300 
			genes and the addition of information on other toxins. Stanley Rose 
			(Genetic Microsystems, Woburn, MA, USA) presented novel systems 
			that enable scientists to use microarray technologies in their own 
			laboratories. These include 'Pin-and-Ring' spotting, the Flying 
			Object(TM) Microscope (high-resolution scanning laser digital 
			imaging) and transcript profiling. Finally, with so much data to be 
			analysed, there is a need for quality control and this was the 
			theme of presentation by Andreas Hohn 
			(<a href="http://www.genedata.com/">GeneData AG</a>, Basel, 
			Switzerland). GeneData Expressionist(TM), a technology-independent 
			programme based on statistical analysis, can check the 
			reproducibility and sensitivity of data, and detects problems in 
			chip production, probe preparation and image analysis.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Conclusions</h2>
			
			<p>A considerable amount of information was covered during this 
			meeting; the quality of the presentations was high and the 
			objectives of this meeting as a forum of exchange of information 
			and discussion were fulfilled. The importance of microarray 
			technology and bioinformatics in the post-genomic era is obvious. 
			These technologies will enable the study of thousands of genes 
			simultaneously to be carried out in any laboratory.</p>
