			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>Drug delivery remains a challenge in management of cancer. Approximately 12.5 million 
			new cases of cancer are being diagnosed worldwide each year and considerable research is in
			progress for drug discovery for cancer. Cancer drug delivery is no longer simply wrapping up
			cancer drugs in a new formulations for different routes of delivery. The focus is on targeted
			cancer therapy. The newer approaches to cancer treatment not only supplement the conventional
			chemotherapy and radiotherapy but also prevent damage to normal tissues and prevent drug
			resistance.</p>
			
			<p>Innovative cancer therapies are based on current concepts of molecular biology of cancer.
			These include antiangiogenic agents, immunotherapy, bacterial agents, viral oncolysis, targeting
			of cyclic-dependent kinases and tyrosine kinase receptors, antisense approaches, gene therapy
			and combination of various methods. Important methods of immunotherapy in cancer involve use of
			cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, cancer vaccines and immunogene therapy.</p>
			
			<p>Several innovative methods of drug delivery are used in cancer. These include use of
			microparticles as carriers of anticancer agents. These may be injected into the arterial
			circulation and guided to the tumor by magnetic field for targeted drug delivery. Polyethylene
			glycol (PEG) technology has been used to overcome some of the barriers to anticancer drug
			delivery. Encapsulating anticancer drugs in liposomes enables targeted drug delivery to tumor
			tissues and prevents damage to the normal surrounding tissues. Monoclonal antibodies can be used
			for the delivery of anticancer payloads such as radionucleotides, toxins and chemotherapeutic
			agents to the tumors.</p>
	
			<p>Antisense oligonucleotides have been in clinical trials for cancer for some time now. RNAi has
			also been applied in oncology. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be targeted to tumors and one
			example is suppression of H-ras gene expression indicating the potential for application in
			therapy of ovarian cancer. Cancer gene therapy is a sophisticated form of drug delivery for
			cancer. Various technologies and companies developing them are described. Nucleic acid-based
			cancer vaccines are also described.</p>		
			
			<p>Drug delivery strategies vary according to the type and location of cancer. Role of drug
			delivery in the management of cancers of the brain, the bladder, the breast, the ovaries and the
			prostate are used as examples to illustrate different approaches both experimental and clinical.
			Biodegradable implants of carmustine are already used in the treatment of malignant brain tumors.</p>
			
			<p>The market value of drug delivery technologies and the anticancer drugs are difficult to
			separate. Cancer market estimates from 2019-2029 are given according to organs involved and the
			types of cancer as well as according to technologies. Distribution of the into major regions is also described.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 238 companies involved in developing innovative cancer therapies and methods of
			delivery are presented along with their 289 collaborations. The bibliography contains over 650
			publications that are cited in the report.The report is supplemented with 66 tables and 20
			figures.</p>
