			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>Gene therapy can be broadly defined as the transfer of defined genetic material 
			to specific target cells of a patient for the ultimate purpose of preventing or 
			altering a particular disease state. Genes and DNA are now being introduced without 
			the use of vectors and various techniques are being used to modify the function of 
			genes in vivo without gene transfer. If one adds to this the cell therapy particularly 
			with use of genetically modified cells, the scope of gene therapy becomes much 
			broader. Gene therapy can now combined with antisense techniques such as RNA 
			interference (RNAi), further increasing the therapeutic applications. This report 
			takes broad overview of gene therapy and is the most up-to-date presentation from 
			the author on this topic built-up from a series of gene therapy report written by 
			him during the past decade including a textbook of gene therapy and a book on gene 
			therapy companies. This report describes the setbacks of gene therapy and renewed 
			interest in the topic</p>
			
			<p>Gene therapy technologies are described in detail including viral vectors, 
			nonviral vectors and cell therapy with genetically modified vectors. Gene therapy 
			is an excellent method of drug delivery and various routes of administration as 
			well as targeted gene therapy are described. There is an introduction to technologies 
			for gene suppression as well as molecular diagnostics to detect and monitor gene 
			expression. Gene editing technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 and CAR-T cell therapies are also included</p>
			
			<p>Clinical applications of gene therapy are extensive and cover most systems and 
			their disorders. Full chapters are devoted to genetic syndromes, cancer, 
			cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and viral infections with emphasis 
			on AIDS. Applications of gene therapy in veterinary medicine, particularly for 
			treating cats and dogs, are included.</p>
			
			<p>Research and development is in progress in both the academic and the industrial 
			sectors. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the US is playing an important part.
			As of 2021, over 2050  clinical trials were completed, were ongoing or 
			had been approved worldwide.A breakdown of these trials is shown according to the geographical areas and applications.   
			
			<p>Since the death of Jesse Gelsinger in the US following a gene therapy treatment, 
			the FDA has further tightened the regulatory control on gene therapy. A further 
			setback was the reports of leukemia following use of retroviral vectors in successful 
			gene therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Several clinical trials were put 
			on hold and many have resumed now. Four gene medicines have been approved by the FDA. The report also discusses the adverse effects 
			of various vectors, safety regulations and ethical aspects of gene therapy including 
			gene editing and germline gene therapy.</p>
			
			<p>The markets for gene therapy have been difficult to estimate as there only a few 
			approved gene therapy products Gene therapy markets	are estimated for the years 2020-2030. The estimates are based on epidemiology of 
			diseases to be treated with gene therapy, the portion of those who will be eligible 
			for these treatments, competing technologies and the technical developments 
			anticipated in the next decades. In spite of some setbacks, the future for gene 
			therapy is bright.The markets for DNA vaccines are calculated separately as only genetically 
			modified vaccines and those using viral vectors are included in the gene therapy markets</p>
			
			<p>The voluminous literature on gene therapy was reviewed and selected 750 references 
			are appended in the bibliography.The references are constantly updated. The text is 
			supplemented with 80 tables and 25 figures.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 205 companies involved in developing gene therapy are presented 
			along with 270 collaborations. There were only 44 companies involved in this area 
			in 1995. In spite of some failures and mergers, the number of companies has increased 
			more than 4-fold in 2 decades. These companies have been followed up since they 
			were the topic of a book on gene therapy companies by the author of this report. 
			John Wiley &amp; Sons published the book in 2000 and from 2001 to 2003, updated 
			versions of these companies (approximately 160 at mid-2003) were available on 
			Wiley's web site. Since that free service was discontinued and the rights reverted 
			to the author, this report remains the only authorized continuously updated version 
			on gene therapy companies.</p>
