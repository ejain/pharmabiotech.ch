			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes and evaluates the molecular diagnostics technologies that
	    will play an important role in practice of medicine, public health, pharmaceutical
	    industry, forensics and biological warfare in the 21st century. This includes several
	    polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies, fluorescent in situ hybridization
	    (FISH), peptide nucleic acids (PNA), electrochemical detection of DNA, sequencing, mitochondrial DNA, biochips,
	    nanotechnology and proteomic technologies.</p>
	    
			<p>Initial applications of molecular diagnostics were mostly for infections but are
	    now increasing in the areas of genetic disorders, preimplantation screening and
	    cancer. Genetic screening tests, despite some restrictions is a promising area for
	    future expansion of in vitro diagnostic market. Molecular diagnostics is being
	    combined with therapeutics and forms an important component of integrated healthcare.
	    Molecular diagnostic technologies are also involved in development of personalized
	    medicine based on pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Currently, there has been a
	    considerable interest in developing rapid diagnostic methods for for point-of-care and biowarfare agents
	    such as anthrax. Molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are described</p>
			
			<p>The number of companies involved in molecular diagnostics has increased remarkably
	    during the past few years. More than 1,000 companies have been identified to be
	    involved in developing molecular diagnostics and 268 of these are profiled in the report along
	    with tabulation of 657 collaborations. Despite the strict regulation, most of the
	    development in molecular diagnostics has taken place in the United States, which has
	    the largest number of companies.</p>
			
			<p>The markets for molecular diagnostics technologies are difficult to estimate.
	    Molecular diagnostics markets overlap with markets for non-molecular diagnostic
	    technologies in the in vitro diagnostic market and are less well defined than those
	    for pharmaceuticals. Molecular diagnostic markets are analyzed for 2020 according to technologies, 
	    applications and geographical regions. Forecasts are made up to 2030. A major portion of the molecular 
	    diagnostic market can be attributed to advances in genomics and proteomics. 
	    Biochip and nanobiotechnology are expected to make a significant contribution to the growth
	    of molecular diagnostics.The market for COVID-19 diagnostics is described separately from other markets for the year 2020 and projected to 2021.</p>
	    
			<p>This  was the first commercial report on this topic and published as "DNA Diagnostics" in 1995 by PJB Publications,
	    UK. A new edition in 1997 "Molecular Diagnostics I" as well as the next edition, "Molecular
	    Diagnostics II" in 1999, were published by Decision Resources Inc, USA. All the three
	    versions of the reports were well received and sold widely. The report has been 
	    rewritten several times since then and is published at Jain PharmaBiotech.</p>
