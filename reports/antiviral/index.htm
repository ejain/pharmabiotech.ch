			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
<p> This report reviews the current state-of-art of antiviral approaches
including vaccines, pharmaceuticals and innovative technologies for delivery of
therapeutics. The introduction starts with a practical classification of viral
diseases according to their commercial importance. Various antiviral approaches
are described including pharmaceuticals and molecular biological therapies such
as gene therapy and RNA interference (RNAi) as well as vaccines for virus
infections. Expert opinion is given about the current problems and needs in
antiviral therapy. SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats)
analysis of antiviral approaches is presented against the background of concept
of an ideal antiviral agent.</p>

<p>A novel feature of this report is the use of nanotechnology in virology and
its potential for antiviral therapeutics. Interaction of nanoparticles with
viruses are described. NanoViricides are polymeric micelles, which act as
nanomedicines to destroy viruses. Various methods for local as well as systemic
delivery of antiviral agents and vaccines are described. Nanobiotechnology plays
an important role in improving delivery of antivirals. Advantages and
limitations of delivery of gene-based, antisense and RNAi antiviral therapeutics
are discussed.</p>

<p>Anti-influenza measures applicable to human as well as avian forms are
described including the recent epidemic of swine flu. Resistance can develop
against neuraminidase inhibitors although it is less than that with adamantanes.
Considering these problems, there is need for a more effective agent.
Investigations into alternative anti-influenza target will probably expand in
the coming years. These include the development of mechanisms to inhibit fusion
between the virus envelope and the cell membrane.</p>

<p>After a discussion of current therapies of AIDS/HIV and their limitations,
new strategies in development of antiviral agents are described. Drug resistance
and toxicities are emerging as major treatment challenges. Based on a review of
technologies and drugs in development, it can be stated that there are good
prospects are of finding a cure for HIV/AIDS in the next decade.</p>

<p>Hepatitis viruses are described with focus on hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
hepatitis B virus (HBV). Despite the presence of numerous drug candidates in the
anti-HCV pipeline, and the commitment of major R&D resources by many
pharmaceutical companies, it might still take several years for any new anti-HCV
drugs to reach the market. Although many companies are focusing their efforts on
developing viral inhibitors, cellular targets in the host are beginning to
emerge as attractive possibilities because they might enable the development of
broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with less chance for developing viral
resistance.</p>

<p>Various commercially important viruses include herpes simplex (HSV) and human
papilloma virus (HPV). There a number of treatments but HSV is not destroyed
completely and remains dormant and activates from time to time to cause various
clinical manifestations. There is discussion about the role of HPV in cervical
cancer and vaccines available now seem to be adequate in preventing HSV-induced
cervical cancer. There is no effective vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) although monoclonal antibody (MAb) treatment is useful for prophylaxis and
reducing the clinical manifestations. There is a need for an agent to eliminate
this virus.</p>

<p>Various viruses that either occur in epidemics or in tropics and some
naturally emerging infectious diseases are described, e.g. viral hemorrhagic
fevers such as dengue and West Nile virus infection. These are a constant threat
and impossible to anticipate. Some of these lack antiviral agents or vaccines
for prevention. Although these include some of the most serious viral disorders,
the development of antiviral agents for these is not commercially attractive.
Current research and approaches to these virus infections, particularly the current 
pandemic of COVID-19, are discussed. There are over 110 drugs and vaccine candidates 
in development of which 3 have been approved by the FDA and other health authorities around the world. 
Vaccination is being carried out in several countries</p>

<p>Markets for antivirals are considered according to viruses and diseases
caused by them and also according to management approaches: antiviral drugs,
vaccines, MAbs and innovative approaches that include immunological and use of
other technologies such as gene therapy, antisense, RNAi and nanobiotechnology.
Antiviral markets are estimated starting with 2020 with projections up to the
year 2030.</p>

<p>Profiles of 197 companies that are involved in developing various
technologies and products are profiled and with 182 collaborations. These
include major pharmaceutical companies (12), Biopharmaceutical companies with 
antiviral products (87), Antiviral drug companies (26) as well as viral vaccine 
companies (71). The report is supplemented with 58 tables, 17 figures and 550 
references from the literature.</p>
