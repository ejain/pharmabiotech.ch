			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>Nanotechnology is the creation and utilization of materials, devices, and systems through the
			control of matter on the nanometer-length scale (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter.
			Nanobiotechnology, an integration of physical sciences, molecular engineering, biology, chemistry
			and biotechnology holds considerable promise of advances in pharmaceuticals and healthcare. The
			report starts with an introduction to various techniques and materials that are relevant to
			nanobiotechnology. It includes some of the physical forms of energy such as nanolasers. Some of
			the technologies are scaling down such as microfluidics to nanofluidic biochips and others are
			constructions from bottom up. Application in life sciences research, particularly at the
			cell level sets the stage for role of nanobiotechnology in healthcare in subsequent chapters.</p>
			
			<p>Some of the earliest applications are in molecular diagnostics. Nanoparticles, particularly
			quantum dots, are playing important roles. In vitro diagnostics, does not have any of the safety
			concerns associated with the fate of nanoparticles introduced into the human body. Numerous
			nanodevices and nanosystems for sequencing single molecules of DNA are feasible. Various
			nanodiagnostics that have been reviewed will improve the sensitivity and extend the present
			limits of molecular diagnostics.</p>		
			
			<p>An increasing use of nanobiotechnology by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is
			anticipated. Nanotechnology will be applied at all stages of drug development - from formulations
			for optimal delivery to diagnostic applications in clinical trials. Many of the assays based on
			nanobiotechnology will enable high-throughput screening. Some of nanostructures such as
			fullerenes are themselves drug candidates as they allow precise grafting of active chemical
			groups in three-dimensional orientations. The most important pharmaceutical applications are in
			drug delivery. Apart from offering a solution to solubility problems, nanobiotechnology provides
			and intracellular delivery possibilities. Skin penetration is improved in transdermal drug
			delivery. A particularly effective application is as nonviral gene therapy vectors.
			Nanotechnology has the potential to provide controlled release devices with autonomous operation
			guided by the needs.</p>
			
			<p>Nanomedicine is now within the realm of reality starting with nanodiagnostics and drug
			delivery facilitated by nanobiotechnology. Miniature devices such as nanorobots could carry out
			integrated diagnosis and therapy by refined and minimally invasive procedures, nanosurgery, as an
			alternative to crude surgery. Applications of nanobiotechnology are described according to various 
			therapeutic systems. Nanotechnology will markedly improve the implants and tissue engineering approaches 
			as well. Of the over 1,000 clinical trials of nanomedicines, approximately 100 are selected and tabulated 
			in major therapeutic areas. Other applications such as for management of biological warfare injuries and 
			poisoning are included. Contribution of nanobiotechnology to nutrition and public health such as supply 
			of purified water are also included. </p>		
			
			<p>There is some concern about the safety of nanoparticles introduced in the human body and
			released into the environment. Research is underway to address these issues. As yet there are no
			FDA directives to regulate nanobiotechnology but as products are ready to enter market, these are
			expected to be in place.</p>
			
			<p>Future nanobiotechnology markets are calculated on the basis of the background markets in the
			areas of application and the share of this market by new technologies and state of development at
			any given year in the future. This is based on a comprehensive and thorough review of the current
			status of nanobiotechnology, research work in progress and anticipated progress. There is
			definite indication of large growth of the market but it will be uneven and cannot be plotted as
			a steady growth curve. Marketing estimates are given according to areas of application,
			technologies and geographical distribution starting with 2020. The largest expansion is expected between the years
			2025 and 2030.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 253 companies, out of over 500 involved in this area, are included in the last
			chapter along with their 185 collaborations.The report is supplemented with 51 Tables, 32 figures and
			800 references to the literature.</p>
