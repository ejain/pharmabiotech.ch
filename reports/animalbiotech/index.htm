			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes and evaluates animal biotechnology and its 
			application in veterinary medicine and pharmaceuticals as well as 
			improvement in food production. Knowledge of animal genetics is important in 
			the application of biotechnology to manage genetic disorders and improve 
			animal breeding. Genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics are also being 
			applied to animal biotechnology.</p>
			
			<p>Transgenic technologies are used for improving milk production and the 
			meat in farm animals as well as for creating models of human diseases. 
			Transgenic animals are used for the production of proteins for human medical 
			use. Biotechnology is applied to facilitate xenotransplantation from animals 
			to humans. Genetic engineering is done in farm animals and nuclear transfer 
			technology has become an important and preferred method for cloning 
			animals.There is discussion of in vitro meat production by culture</p>
			
			<p>Biotechnology has potential applications in the management of several 
			animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, classical swine fever, avian flu and 
			bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The most important biotechnology-based 
			products consist of vaccines, particularly genetically engineered or DNA 
			vaccines. Gene therapy for diseases of pet animals is a fast developing area 
			because many of the technologies used in clinical trials humans were 
			developed in animals and many of the diseases of cats and dogs are similar 
			to those in humans.RNA interference technology is now being applied for 
			research in veterinary medicine</p>
			
			<p>Molecular diagnosis is assuming an important place in veterinary 
			practice.  Polymerase chain reaction and its modifications are considered to 
			be important. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and enzyme-linked 
			immunosorbent assays are also widely used. Newer biochip-based technologies 
			and biosensors are also finding their way in veterinary diagnostics.</p>
			
			<p>Biotechnology products are approved by the Center for Veterinary Medicine of 
			the FDA. Regulatory issues relevant to animal biotechnology are 
			described.</p>
			
			<p>Approximately 81 companies have been identified to be involved in animal 
			biotechnology and are profiled in the report. These are a mix of animal 
			healthcare companies and biotechnology companies. Top companies in this area are 
			identified and ranked. Information is given about the research activities of 11 
			veterinary and livestock research institutes. Important 70 collaborations in this area are shown.</p>
			
			<p>Share of biotechnology-based products and services in 2020 is analyzed and the market is
			projected to 2030.</p>
			
			<p>The text is supplemented with 36 tables and 6 figures.Selected 260 references from the literature are appended.</p>
