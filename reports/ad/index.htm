			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge in management. With nearly 8 million sufferers from
			this condition in the seven major markets of the world and anticipated increases in the future.
			Considerable research is in progress to understand the pathomechanism of the disease and find a
			cure. The only drugs approved currently are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors but they do not
			correct the basic 	pathology of the disease, beta amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles.
			Several new approaches emphasize neuroprotection as well.</p>
			
			<p>Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is an important first step in management. Several
			biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine can detect the disease. They provide a
			valuable aid to the clinical examination and neuropsychological testing which are the main
			diagnostic methods supplemented by brain imaging. Genotyping, particularly of ApoE gene alleles
			is also useful in the evaluation of cases and planning management.</p>
			
			<p>The current management of Alzheimer's disease is reviewed and it involves a multidisciplinary
			approach. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are mostly a symptomatic treatment but some claims are
			made about a neuroprotective effect. Currently the only approved neuroprotective therapy in
			is memantine. Management of these patients also require neuroleptics for aggressive behavior and
			antidepressants. There is an emphasis on early detection at the stage of mild cognitive
			impairment and early institution of neuroprotective measures. The value of mental exercise in
			delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease is being recognized.</p>
	
			<p>Research in Alzheimer's disease still aims at elucidating the basic pathomechanisms. Animal
			models are important for research, particularly in testing some of the potential therapeutic
			approaches. There is considerable research in progress at the various centers, some of which is
			funded by the National Institute of Aging of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
			
			<p>Over 300 different compounds are at various stages of development for the treatment of
			Alzheimer's disease. These are classified and described. There are non-pharmacological approaches
			such as vagal nerve stimulation and cerebrospinal fluid shunting, which are in clinical trials.
			Ongoing as well as discontinued clinical trials of AD are tabulated.</p>
			
			<p>Alzheimer's disease market in the seven major markets is analyzed for the year 2020. Several 
			new therapies are expected to be in the market and the shares of various types of approaches are estimated 
			for the future up to the year 2030. As a background to the markets, pharmacoeconomic aspects of care of Alzheimer disease
			patients and patterns of practice are reviewed in the seven major markets.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 117 companies involved in developing diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's
			disease are presented along with 89 collaborations. The bibliography contains over 900
			publications that are cited in the report.The report is supplemented with 48 tables and 28
			figures.</p>
