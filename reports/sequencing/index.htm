			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
<p>This report briefly reviews basics of human genome variations, development of
sequencing technologies, and their applications. Current large and small
sequencers are described as well as companies developing them. Various applications 
of sequencing are described including those for genetics, medical diagnostics, 
drug discovery and cancer. Next generation sequencing technologies, both second 
and third generations, are reviewed. Companies developing software for analysis 
of sequencing data are also included. Selected academic institutes conducting 
research in sequencing are also listed.</p>

<p>Current market is mostly for research applications and future markets will be
other applications related to healthcare. The value of DNA sequencer market in
2020 is described with estimates for 2025 and 2030. Various methods and factors
on which market estimates depend are described briefly. Markets are tabulated according 
to geographical areas as well as applications. Small sequencers form the 
basis of SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. Several
marketing strategies have been outlined.</p>

<p>The report includes profiles of 150 companies involved in sequencing and their
173 collaborations. The report text is supplementd by 42 tables, 24 figures and 500
selected references to the literature.</p>
