			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>The aim of personalized medicine or individualized treatment is to match the right drug to the
			right patient and, in some cases, even to design the appropriate treatment for a patient 
			according to his/her genotype. This report describes the latest concepts of development of 
			personalized medicine based on pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics,pharmacoproteomics, and metabolomics. Basic
			technologies of molecular diagnostics play an important role, particularly those for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
			genotyping. Biomarkers play an important role in personalized medicine. Diagnosis is integrated with therapy for selection 
			of treatment as well for monitoring the results. There is emphasis on early detection and prevention of disease in modern medicine. 
			Biochip/microarray technologies and next generation sequencing are also important. The concept of personalized medicine described 
			in this report remains remains the best way to integrate new technologies such as nanobiotechnology for improving healthcare. 
			Finally bioinformatics is needed to analyze the immense amount of data generated by various technologies.</p>
			
			<p>Pharmacogenetics, the study of influence of genetic factors on drug action and metabolism, is
			used for predicting adverse reactions of drugs. Several enzymes are involved in drug metabolism
			of which the most important ones are those belonging to the family of cytochrome P450. The
			knowledge of the effects of polymorphisms of genes for the enzymes is applied in drug discovery
			and development as well as in clinical use of drugs. Cost-effective methods for genotyping are
			being developed and it would be desirable to include this information in the patient's record for
			the guidance of the physician to individualize the treatment. Pharmacogenomics, a term that
			overlaps with pharmacogenetics but is distinct, deals with the application of genomics to drug
			discovery and development. It involves the mechanism of action of drugs on cells as revealed by 
			gene expression patterns. Pharmacoproteomics is an important contribution to personalized
			medicine as it is a more functional representation of patient-to-patient variation than that
			provided by genotyping.A 'pharmacometabonomic' approach to personalizing drug treatment is also described. </p>
			
			<p>Biological therapies such as those which use patient's own cells are considered to be
			personalized medicines. Vaccines are prepared from individual patient's tumor cells.
			Individualized therapeutic strategies using monoclonal bodies can be directed at specific genetic
			and immunologic targets. Ex vivo gene therapy involves the genetic modification of the patient's
			cells in vitro, prior to reimplantation of these cells in the patient's body.</p>
			
			<p>Various technologies are integrated to develop personalized therapies for specific therapeutic
			areas described in the report. Examples of this are genotyping for drug resistance in HIV
			infection, personalized therapy of cancer, antipsychotics for schizophrenia, antidepressant
			therapy, antihypertensive therapy and personalized approach to neurological disorders. Although
			genotyping is not yet a part of clinically accepted routine, it is expected to have this status
			by the year 2023.</p>
			
			<p>Several players are involved in the development of personalized therapy. Pharmaceutical and
			biotechnology companies have taken a leading role in this venture in keeping with their future
			role as healthcare enterprises rather than mere developers of technologies and manufacturers of
			medicines.</p>
	
			<p>Ethical issues are involved in the development of personalized medicine mainly in the area of
			genetic testing. These along with social issues and consideration of race in the development of
			personalized medicine are discussed. Regulatory issues are discussed mainly with reference to
			the FDA guidelines on pharmacogenomics.</p>
			
			<p>Increase in efficacy and safety of treatment by individualizing it has benefits in financial
			terms. Information is presented to show that personalized medicine will be cost-effective in
			healthcare systems. For the pharmaceutical companies, segmentation of the market may not leave
			room for conventional blockbusters but smaller and exclusive markets for personalized medicines
			would be profitable. Marketing opportunities for such a system are described with market
			estimates from 2020-2030.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 300 companies involved in developing technologies for personalized medicines,
			along with 583 collaborations. Finally the bibliography contains over
			750 selected publications cited in the report.The report is supplemented by 88 tables and 50
			figures.</p>
