			<h2><a id="summary" name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes and evaluates cell therapy technologies and methods, which
			have already started to play an important role in the practice of medicine.
			Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is replacing the old fashioned bone marrow
			transplants. Role of cells in drug discovery is also described. Cell therapy is bound to become a part of medical practice.</p>
			
			<p>Stem cells are discussed in detail in one chapter. Some light is thrown on the
			current controversy of embryonic sources of stem cells and comparison with adult
			sources. Other sources of stem cells such as the placenta, cord blood and fat removed
			by liposuction are also discussed. Stem cells can also be genetically modified prior
			to transplantation.</p>
			
			<p>Cell therapy technologies overlap with those of gene therapy, cancer vaccines,
			drug delivery, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Pharmaceutical applications of stem cells including those in drug discovery are also described. Various types of cells
			used, methods of preparation and culture, encapsulation and genetic engineering of
			cells are discussed. Sources of cells, both human and animal (xenotransplantation)
			are discussed. Methods of delivery of cell therapy range from injections to surgical
			implantation using special devices.</p>
			
			<p>Cell therapy has applications in a large number of disorders. The most important
			are diseases of the nervous system and cancer which are the topics for separate
			chapters. Other applications include cardiac disorders (myocardial infarction and
			heart failure), diabetes mellitus, diseases of bones and joints, genetic disorders,
			and wounds of the skin and soft tissues.</p>
			
			<p>Regulatory and ethical issues involving cell therapy are important and are
			discussed. Current political debate on the use of stem cells from embryonic
			sources (hESCs) is also presented. Safety is an essential consideration of any new
			therapy and regulations for cell therapy are those for biological
			preparations.</p>
			
<p>The cell-based markets was analyzed for 2020, and projected to 2030.The
markets are analyzed according to therapeutic categories, technologies and
geographical areas.
The largest expansion will be in diseases of the central nervous system, cancer
and cardiovascular disorders.
Skin and soft tissue repair as well as diabetes mellitus will be other major
markets.</p>

<p>The number of companies involved in cell therapy has increased remarkably
during
the past few years. More than 500 companies have been identified to be involved
in cell therapy and 317 of these are profiled in part II of the report along with
tabulation of 306 alliances. Of these companies, 171 are involved in stem cells.
Profiles of 73 academic institutions in the US involved in cell therapy are also
included in part II along with their commercial collaborations. The text is
supplemented with 67 Tables and 26 Figures. The bibliography contains 1,200
selected references, which are cited in the text.</p>
