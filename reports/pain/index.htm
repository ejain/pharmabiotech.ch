			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes the latest concepts of pathomechanisms of pain as a basis for management
			and development of new pharmacotherapies for pain. Major segments of the pain market are
			arthritis, neuropathic pain and cancer pain. Because pain is a subjective sensation, it is
			difficult to evaluate objectively in clinical trials. Various tools for pain measurement are
			described, including brain imaging.</p>
			
			<p>Most of the currently used analgesic drugs fall into the categories of 
			opioids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as COX-2 inhibitors. 
			Non-opioid analgesics include ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
			antagonist. Adjuvant analgesics include antidepressants and antiepileptic 
			drugs used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Management of pain is 
			multidisciplinary and includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
			methods such as acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and 
			surgery. Various pain syndromes require different approaches in management, 
			for example, the main category of drugs for migraine are triptans such as 
			sumatriptan.</p>
			
			<p>Drug delivery is an important consideration in pain treatment. Controlled release 
			preparations provide a steady delivery of analgesics. Well-known non-injection methods 
			such astransdermal, pulmonary and intranasal application have been used. Topical analgesics 
			and local anesthetics are also available. Devices such as implanted pumps are used for 
			delivery of drugs such as opioids intrathecally (introduction into spinal subarachnoid 
			space by lumbar puncture) in patients with cancer pain.</p>
			
			<p>The wide variety of drugs in development includes opioid receptor ligands, bradykinin 
			antagonists, mPGES-1 inhibitors, glutamate receptor antagonists, substance P and
			neurokinin receptor antagonists, norepinephrine transporter inhibitors,P2X2 neuron receptor 
			antagonists and nitric oxide-based analgesics. A number of cannabinoids are also in development 
			for pain. Fish-derived tetrodotoxin was initially focused on indication of opiate addiction withdrawal 
			but is found to have an analgesic action as well. Cone shells contain therapeutically useful peptides 
			including the conotoxins, and one such peptide, ziconotide, has been approved. Various cell and gene 
			therapies are also being developed for the management of pain.</p>
			
			<p>Advances in molecular and biological techniques are markedly advancing our undestanding of 
			pain. Understanding the pathophysiology of pain is an important factor in 
			discovery of rational therapies for pain. Advances in pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics are
			enabling the development of personalized approaches to the management of pain.</p>
			
			<p>Over 500 companies have been identified to be involved in developing or marketing pain 
			therapeutics and 173 of these are profiled in the report along with 156 collaborations. These are
			a mix of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies.</p>
			
			<p>The worldwide analgesic markets were analyzed for the year 2020 and projected to 2030. Calculations 
			are based on the epidemiology of various painful conditions and the development of analgesic drugs and devices. 
			Unfulfilled needs for analgesics are identified and strategies are outlined to develop markets for analgesic drugs.
			The report is supplemented with 78 tables, 25 figures, and 600 selected references to the literature.</p>
