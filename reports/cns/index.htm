			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>The delivery of drugs to central nervous system (CNS) is a challenge in the treatment of
			neurological disorders. Drugs may be administered directly into the CNS or administered
			systematically (e.g., by intravenous injection) for targeted action in the CNS. The major
			challenge to CNS drug delivery is the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the access of drugs
			to the brain substance.</p>
			
			<p>Advances in understanding of the cell biology of the BBB have opened new avenues and
			possibilities for improved drug delivery to the CNS. Several carrier or transport systems,
			enzymes, and receptors that control the penetration of molecules have been identified in the BBB
			endothelium. Receptor-mediated transcytosis can transport peptides and proteins across the BBB.
			Methods are available to assess the BBB permeability of drugs at the discovery stage to avoid
			development of drugs that fail to reach their target site of action in the CNS.</p>
			
			<p>Various strategies that have been used for manipulating the blood-brain barrier 
			for drug delivery to the brain include osmotic and chemical opening of the blood-brain 
			barrier as well as the use of transport/carrier systems. Other strategies for drug 
			delivery to the brain involve bypassing the BBB. Various pharmacological agents have 
			been used to open the BBB and direct invasive methods can introduce therapeutic 
			agents into the brain substance. It is important to consider not only the net delivery 
			of the agent to the CNS, but also the ability of the agent to access the relevant 
			target site within the CNS. Various routes of administration as well as conjugations 
			of drugs, e.g., with liposomes and nanoparticles, are considered. Some routes of 
			direct administration to the brain are non-invasive such as transnasal route whereas 
			others involve entry into the CNS by devices and needles such as in case of intrathecal 
			and intracerebroventricular delivery. Systemic therapy by oral and parenteral routes is 
			considered along with sustained and controlled release to optimize the CNS action of 
			drugs. Among the three main approaches to drug delivery to the CNS - systemic 
			administration, injection into CSF pathways, and direct injection into the brain - 
			the greatest developments is anticipated to occur in the area of targeted delivery 
			by systemic administration.</p>
			
			<p>Many of the new developments in the treatment of neurological disorders will be 
			biological therapies and these will require innovative methods for delivery. Cell, 
			gene and antisense therapies are not only innovative treatments for CNS disorders 
			but also involve sophisticated delivery methods. RNA interference (RNAi) as a form 
			of antisense therapy is also described.</p>		
			
			<p>The role of drug delivery is depicted in the background of various therapies for 
			neurological diseases including drugs in development and the role of special delivery 
			preparations. Pain is included as it is considered to be a neurological disorder. A 
			special chapter is devoted to drug delivery for brain tumors. Cell and gene therapies 
			will play an important role in the treatment of neurological disorders in the future.</p>
			
			<p>The method of delivery of a drug to the CNS has an impact on the drug's commercial 
			potential. The market for CNS drug delivery technologies is directly linked to the CNS 
			drug market. Values are calculated for the total CNS market and the share of drug delivery 
			technologies. Starting with the market values for the year 2020, projections are made to the 					
			years 2025 and 2030. The markets values are tabulated according to therapeutic areas, 
			technologies and geographical areas. Unmet needs for further development in CNS drug delivery 
			technologies are identified according to the important methods of delivery of therapeutic 
			substances to the CNS. Finally suggestions are made for strategies to expand CNS delivery 
			markets. Besides development of new products, these include application of innovative methods 
			of delivery to older drugs to improve their action and extend their patent life.</p>
			
			<p>Profiles of 77 companies involved in drug delivery for CNS disorders are presented along with
			their technologies, products and 101 collaborations. These include pharmaceutical companies that
			develop CNS drugs and biotechnology companies that provide technologies for drug delivery. A
			number of cell and gene therapy companies with products in development for CNS disorders are
			included. References contains over 420 publications that are cited in the report. The report is
			supplemented with 52 tables and 17 figures.</p>
