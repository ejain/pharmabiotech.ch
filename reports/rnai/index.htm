			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
<p> RNA interference (RNAi) or gene silencing involves the use of double
stranded RNA (dsRNA).
Once inside the cell, this material is processed into short 21-23 nucleotide
RNAs termed siRNAs
that are used in a sequence-specific manner to recognize and destroy
complementary RNA.
The report compares RNAi with other antisense approaches using oligonucleotides,
aptamers,
ribozymes, peptide nucleic acid and locked nucleic acid.</p>

<p>Various RNAi technologies are described, along with design and methods of
manufacture of
siRNA reagents. These include chemical synthesis by in vitro transcription and
use of plasmid or
viral vectors. Other approaches to RNAi include DNA-directed RNAi (ddRNAi) that
is used to
produce dsRNA inside the cell, which is cleaved into siRNA by the action of
Dicer, a specific
type of RNAse III. MicroRNAs are derived by processing of short hairpins that
can inhibit the
mRNAs. Expressed interfering RNA (eiRNA) is used to express dsRNA
intracellularly from DNA
plasmids.</p>

<p>Delivery of therapeutics to the target tissues is an important consideration.
siRNAs can be
delivered to cells in culture by electroporation or by transfection using
plasmid or viral
vectors. In vivo delivery of siRNAs can be carried out by injection into tissues
or blood
vessels or use of synthetic and viral vectors.</p>

<p>Because of its ability to silence any gene once the sequence is known, RNAi
has been adopted
as the research tool to discriminate gene function. After the genome of an
organism is
sequenced, RNAi can be designed to target every gene in the genome and target
for specific
phenotypes. Several methods of gene expression analysis are available and there
is still need
for sensitive methods of detection of gene expression as a baseline and
measurement after gene
silencing. RNAi microarray has been devised and can be tailored to meet the
needs for high
throughput screens for identifying appropriate RNAi probes. RNAi is an important
method for
analyzing gene function and identifying new drug targets that uses
double-stranded RNA to knock
down or silence specific genes. With the advent of vector-mediated siRNA
delivery methods it is
now possible to make transgenic animals that can silence gene expression stably.
These
technologies point to the usefulness of RNAi for drug discovery.</p>

<p>RNAi can be rationally designed to block the expression of any target gene,
including genes
for which traditional small molecule inhibitors cannot be found. Areas of
therapeutic
applications include virus infections, cancer, genetic disorders and
neurological diseases. Research at academic centers that is relevant to 
RNAi-based therapeutics is mentioned. </p>
	
<p>Regulatory, safety and patent issues are discussed. Side
effects can result from unintended interaction between an siRNA compound and an
unrelated host gene. If RNAi compounds are designed poorly, there is an 
increased chance for non-specific interaction with host genes that may cause 
adverse effects in the host. However, there are no major safety concerns and 
regulations are in preliminary stages as the clinical trials are still ongoing 
and there are no marketed products. Many of the patents are still pending.</p>

<p>The markets for RNAi are difficult to define as no RNAi-based product is
approved yet but several are in clinical trials. The major use of RNAi reagents
is in research but it partially overlaps that of drug discovery and therapeutic
development. Various markets relevant to RNAi are analyzed from 2020 to 2030.
Markets are also analyzed according to technologies and use of
siRNAs, miRNAs, etc.</p>

<p>Profiles of 168 companies involved in developing RNAi technologies are
presented along with 231 collaborations. They are a mix of companies that supply reagents
and technologies (nearly half of all) and companies that use the technologies for drug discovery.
Out of these, 34 are developing RNAi-based therapeutics and 36 are involved in microRNAs. 
The bibliography contains selected 650 publications that are cited in the report. The text is 
supplemented with 39 tables and 18 figures.</p>
