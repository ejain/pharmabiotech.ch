			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes the latest concepts of the role of nitric oxide (NO) in 
			health and disease as a basis for therapeutics and development of new drugs. 
			Major segments of the market for nitric oxide-based drugs are described as well as the 
			companies involved in developing them.</p>
			
			<p>Nitric oxide (NO) can generate free radicals as well as scavenge them. It also functions 
			as a signaling molecule and has an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.
			A major focus is delivery of NO by various technologies. Another approach is modulation of 
			nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts L-arginine to NO. NOS can be stimulated as well
			as inhibited by pharmacological and gene therapy approaches.</p>
			
			<p>Important therapeutic areas for NO-based therapies are inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular 
			diseases, erectile dysfunction, inflammation, pain and neuroprotection. The first therapeutic 
			use of NO was by inhaltion for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). NO-donors, NO-mimics 
			and NOS modulators are described and compared along with developmental status. NO-related 
			mechanisms of action in existing drugs are identified.</p>
			
			<p> Various pharmacological approaches are described along with their therapeutic relevance. 
			Various approaches are compared using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) 
			analysis. NO-based therapies are compared with conventional approaches and opportunities for 
			combination with modern biotechnology approaches are described. </p>
			
<p>Share of drugs where NO is involved in the mechanism of action is analyzed in
the worldwide pharmaceutical market for 2020 and is projected to 2025 and 2030
as new drugs with NO-based mechanisms are introduced into the market. Various strategies for developing such drugs are
discussed.</p>

<p>Several companies have a product or products involving NO and free radicals.
The report includes profiles of 36 companies involved in this area of which 10
have a significant interest in NO-based therapeutics. Other players are
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as suppliers of products for
NO research. Unfulfilled needs in the development of NO-based therapeutics are
identified. Important 18 collaborations in this area are tabulated.</p>

<p> There are numerous publications relevant to NO. Selected 500 references are included in the bibliography. The text is
supplemented with 26 tables and 30 figures. It is concluded that the future
prospects for NO-based therapies are bright and fit in with biotechnology-based
approaches to modern drug discovery and development. It is anticipated that some
of these products will help in meeting the unfulfilled needs in human
therapeutics.</p>
