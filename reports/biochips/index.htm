			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
<p>This report is an analysis of biochip/microarray markets based on technologies and
applications. The report starts with a description of technologies as a basis
for estimation of markets. Technologies include array comparative genomic hybridization 
(CGH), copy number variation (CNV), DNA methylation, ChIP-Chip, RNA splice variants, 
and microRNA. Separate chapters are devoted to protein biochips/microarrays, microfluidics 
and nanobiotechnology-based nano-arrays. </p>

<p> Various applications of biochips and microarrays are described throughout the report. 
Areas of application such as point-of-care, genetic screening, cancer, and
diagnosis of infections are included. Separate chapters are devoted to applications 
in drug discovery and development as well as personalized medicine</p>

<p>The report provides current share of each segment: market size in 2020 and
projected value for the years 2025 and 2030. Gene expression has the largest
share and is an established market. Share of microarray technologies in other
areas will grow with the maximum growth in RNA splice variants followed by
epigenetics. The growth in protein microarrays is somewhat less, partly because
it is more mature than the other submarkets and has already shown considerable
growth in the past. Impact of next generation sequencing on segments of
microarray markets is identified. Customer requirements and unmet needs are
described. Markets are also analyzed according to geographical areas.</p>

<p>Brief profiles of companies involved in biochip/microarray technologies are
provided. Currently selected 94 companies are included along with listing of 123
collaborations between companies. The text is supplemented by 21 tables, 11
figures and 140 references to literature.</p>
