		<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
		
		<p>Drug delivery to the cardiovascular system is different from delivery to other 
		systems because of the anatomy and physiology of the vascular system; it supplies 
		blood and nutrients to all organs of the body. Drugs can be introduced into the 
		vascular system for systemic effects or targeted to an organ via the regional blood
		supply. In addition to the usual formulations of drugs such as controlled release, 
		devices are used as well. This report starts with an introduction to molecular 
		cardiology and discusses its relationship to biotechnology and drug delivery 
		systems.</p>
		
		<p>Drug delivery to the cardiovascular system is approached at three levels: (1) 
		routes of drug delivery; (2) formulations; and finally (3) applications to various 
		diseases. Formulations for drug delivery to the cardiovascular system range from 
		controlled release preparations to delivery of proteins and peptides. Cell and gene 
		therapies, including antisense and RNA interference, are described in full chapters 
		as they are the most innovative methods of delivery of therapeutics. Various methods 
		of improving systemic administration of drugs for cardiovascular disorders are 
		described including use of nanotechnology.</p>		
		
		<p>Cell-selective targeted drug delivery has emerged as one of the most significant 
		areas of biomedical engineering research, to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of a 
		drug by strictly localizing its pharmacological activity to a pathophysiologically 
		relevant tissue system. These concepts have been applied to targeted drug delivery 
		to the cardiovascular system. Devices for drug delivery to the cardiovascular system 
		are also described. </p>

		<p>Role of drug delivery in various cardiovascular disorders such as myocardial 
		ischemia, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia is discussed. Cardioprotection is also discussed. Some of the preparations 
		and technologies are also applicable to peripheral arterial diseases. Controlled release 
		systems are based on chronopharmacology, which deals with the effects of circadian 
		biological rhythms on drug actions.A full chapter is devoted to drug-eluting stents as 
		treatment for restenosis following stenting of coronary arteries.Fifteen companies are 
		involved in drug-eluting stents.</p>		
		
		<p>New cell-based therapeutic strategies are being developed in response to the 
		shortcomings of available treatments for heart disease. Potential repair by cell grafting 
		or mobilizing endogenous cells holds particular attraction in heart disease, where the 
		meager capacity for cardiomyocyte proliferation likely contributes to the irreversibility 
		of heart failure. Cell therapy approaches include attempts to reinitiate cardiomyocyte
		 proliferation in the adult, conversion of fibroblasts to contractile myocytes, 
		 conversion of bone marrow stem cells into cardiomyocytes, and transplantation of 
		 myocytes or other cells into injured myocardium.</p>
		
		<p>Advances in molecular pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases have brought 
		gene therapy within the realm of possibility as a novel approach to treatment of 
		these diseases. It is hoped that gene therapy will be less expensive and affordable 
		because the techniques involved are simpler than those involved in cardiac bypass 
		surgery, heart transplantation and stent implantation. Gene therapy would be a more 
		physiologic approach to deliver vasoprotective molecules to the site of vascular 
		lesion. Gene therapy is not only a sophisticated method of drug delivery; it may at 
		time need drug delivery devices such as catheters for transfer of genes to various 
		parts of the cardiovascular system.</p>
		
		<p>The cardiovascular drug delivery markets are estimated for the years 2020 to 
		2030 on the basis of epidemiology and total markets for cardiovascular therapeutics. 
		The estimates take into consideration the anticipated advances and availability of 
		various technologies, particularly drug delivery devices in the future. Markets for 
		drug-eluting stents are calculated separately. Role of drug delivery in developing 
		cardiovascular markets is defined and unmet needs in cardiovascular drug delivery 
		technologies are identified.</p>
		
		<p>Selected 83 companies that either develop technologies for drug delivery to the 
		cardiovascular system or products using these technologies are profiled and 80 
		collaborations between companies are tabulated. The bibliography includes 200 
		selected references from recent literature on this topic. The report is supplemented 
		with 31 tables and 9 figures</p>
