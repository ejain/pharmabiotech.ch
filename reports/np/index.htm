			<h2><a name="summary">Summary</a></h2>
			
			<p>This report describes the role of neuroprotection in acute disorders such as
			stroke and injuries of the nervous system as well as in chronic diseases such as
			neurodegenerative disorders because many of the underlying mechanisms of damage to
			neural tissues are similar in all these conditions and several products are used in
			more than one disorder. Over 500 products have been investigated for neuroprotective
			effects including those from the categories of free radical scavengers,
			anti-excitotoxic agents, apoptosis (programmed cell death) inhibitors,
			anti-inflammatory agents, neurotrophic factors, metal ion chelators, ion channel
			modulators and gene therapy. Some of the agents are old established pharmaceuticals
			whereas others are new biotechnology products.</p>
			
			<p>Pathomechanisms of diseases are described with steps at which neuroprotective
			therapies are directed. Diseases covered include cerebrovascular disorders, traumatic
			brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
			Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and
			ischemic optic neuropathy as well as retinal degeneration. Although anesthetics such
			as propofol are neuroprotective as well, neuroprotection during surgery and
			anesthesia is discussed with the aim of preventing and treating complications that
			result in CNS damage.</p>
			
			<p>The report contains profiles of 141 companies that have a neuroprotective product
			or products along with 126 collaborations. Some of the products in development at academic 
			institutions that do not have a commercial sponsor are also included. Although an 
			up-to-date search of the literature was performed and selected 1,100 references are included. Clinical trials of
			various neuroprotective agents are described and failures of trials are analyzed with suggestions for improving the selection of drugs and
			design of trials.The report is supplemented with 85 tables and 27 figures.</p>
			
			<p>Market analysis of  currently used products that have a neuroprotective
			effect are analyzed for the year 2020. Some of these products are approved for other indications but are
			known to have a neuroprotective effect. With the approval of new products and
			takeover of markets for obsolete symptomatic therapies, the neuroprotection market
			value will rise by the year 2025 when it will constitute a major and
			important component of the CNS market. Forecasts are made until 2030. By that time neuroprotection will be an
			established part of the neurological practice and measures will be available to
			achieve this effectively.</p>
